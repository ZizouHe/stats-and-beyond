# Expectation-maximization

## Reference

- The most impressive explanation I have ever read: [Michael I. Jordan, An Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models, Chapter 11](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/prelims/chapter11.pdf).

- See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm#Proof_of_correctness) as well as [CS229 Andrew Ng's lecture notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes8.pdf), also very clear.

- My notes on EM algorithm is attached.
